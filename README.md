## Pixellate
This effect applies a "mosaic" effect to the input texture. I added a slider that allows the user to control the intensity or block size of the mosaic. There's also a checkbox to enable and disable the effect.

## Color Swap
Color swap enables the user to pick one color of their choice to replace with another color of their choice using two color pickers. I also included a tolerance slider, which enables colors that are similar to the original color to be replaced. This effect also includes a checkbox to toggle it on and off.

## Color Key
This effect is similar to color swap, but you can replace the "original color" parameter in Color Swap with a texture instead. It behaves just like a greenscreen would.

## Grayscale
This is a simple grayscale slider, you can use it to transition the image from it's original colors to a full greyscale image. This also behaves like a saturation slider.

## Hue Slider
This effect speaks for itself. Using the slider, you can modify the hue of the input image.

## Invert
This effect is an invert slider. Using the slider, you can mix the image between its original colors and a fully inverted version of the original colors.

## Contrast
This is a contrast slider. It uses a simple contrast algorithm and allows the user to increase or decrease the contrast of the image.

## Sepia
This effect simulates a sepia filter. The sepia filter adds a warm effect to the input image and can be toggled on and off with a checkbox.

## Film Grain
This effect simulates the grainy effect that's sometimes used in movies, like Fight Club. It can be toggled on and off using the checkbox.

## Old TV
This is my favorite effect, and it simulates the look of an old CRT tv. It features scanlines and also has a small ghost effect to the image to add to the immersion. It can be toggled on and off using a checkbox.
