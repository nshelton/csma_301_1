# Basic Effect Setup and Information


## Swizzle

This is an effect that accesses the color channels in different orders. In order to see this effect, drag the slider named "Swizzle" in the inspector during runtime.

From 0 - <1, color channels are in rgba
From 1 - <2, color channels are in gbra
At 2, color channels are in brga


## Color Shifting

This effect parses and displays the rgb channels in the pixels by a given offset. To change the amount the channels are offset, drag the "Color_shift" slider in the inspector during runtime.


## Blur

This effect blurs the output. To change the intensity of the blur, drag the "Blur" slider in the inspector during runtime.


## Chroma Tinting

This effect tints the output with the corresponding color chosen in the inspector. To do so, make sure the "Apply Tint" slider value = 1 (this is the bool to apply Chroma Tint), then select tint color in the inspector by clicking the HDR color picker and choosing desired Tint color. 


## Y Displacement Wave Effect

This effect displaces the y coordinates of the video output relative to the x-axis like a moving sine wave over a given time. To do so, drag the slider named "Displace Y" to intensify displacement wave effect.


## X Displacement Wave Effect

This effect displaces the x coordinates of the video output relative to the y-axis like a moving sine wave over a given time. To do so, drag the slider named "Displace X" to intensify displacement wave effect.


## Inversion

This effect inverts the color of the video output. To do so, drag the slider named "Invert" to see this effect.


## Greyscale

This effect applies greyscale to the video output based on a predetermined color vector for a type of grey. To do so, drag the slider named "Greyscale Active" to apply greyscale effect. 


## Contrast

This effect applies contrast to the video output. To improve or reduce contrast, drag the slider named "Contrast" to apply this effect.


## Brightness

This effect Brightens the video output. To do so, drag the slider named "Brightness" to any value over 1 to see this effect.
