Chanel's Shaders
---
Note: All effects are controlled by sliders in the Inspector of the webcam.

## Brightness
Brightness allows the user to adjust the how much light comes into the camera.

## Invert 
The invert shader flips the dark areas to light and the light areas to dark.

## Blur 
This blur effect is not too dramatic. The effect will slightly blur the image output horizontally and vertically.

## Red Overlay 
Red overlay will display the red tones of the image output.

## Grayscale
Grayscale will take the RGB values of the camera view, and it will adjust the values to get a reasonable gray color.

## Noise 
The noise effect will change the regular camera view to a very noisey/grainy image. Similarly, this shader can be compared to the images of some comics.

## Shift 
Shift will shift offset the RGB values. From this, the user can see that the red and blue values will shift to either the left or right, and the green values will remain in its original place.

## Displace 
The displace shader will output an overlay that moves in the direction of a sin curve.

## Perspective 
Perspective will output an effect that is most similar to a human's point of view. For example, when an individual is standing in the middle of a path, the path they are closest to appears to be much larger; however, the path that is further appears to me much smaller. From this example, one can see how this shader will output an individual's point of view in a diagonal motion.

## Camera Transition 
The camera transition shader is imitating an old film reel. When adjusting the slider for this effect, a lower slider value will give a ghostlike effct.
